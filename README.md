A collection of SQL analyses addressing real-world business questions across marketing, operations, and customer service using Brazilian e-commerce data.

## Background

During my time at IBM, I regularly fielded ad hoc requests from stakeholders across different functions—each requiring quick turnaround, clear communication, and actionable insights. This portfolio recreates that experience by tackling similar business scenarios with a public e-commerce dataset.

The goal isn't just to write SQL queries, but to demonstrate the full analytical process: understanding stakeholder needs, scoping the right analysis, delivering insights that drive decisions, and knowing when to dig deeper versus when to keep it simple.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to translate business requests into actionable SQL queries and insights. Each scenario reflects the kind of ad hoc analysis a data analyst handles regularly—from evaluating seller performance to measuring campaign effectiveness.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data)

The dataset includes order details, customer information, seller data, product categories, and payment records from a Brazilian e-commerce platform.
